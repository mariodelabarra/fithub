## Core Modules

### Workout Module

The **Workout module** forms the core of the current FitHub implementation, providing comprehensive workout and exercise management capabilities.

**Key components include:**

| Layer      | Component                               | Purpose                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| API        | `FitHub.Platform.Workout.API`           | REST endpoints for workout-related operations   |
| Service    | `FitHub.Platform.Workout.Service`       | Business logic and orchestration               |
| Domain     | `FitHub.Platform.Workout.Domain`        | Core domain entities and business rules        |
| Repository | `FitHub.Platform.Workout.Repository`    | Data access and persistence                    |

## Common Components

FitHub utilizes shared components across modules to promote code reuse and maintainability:

| Component                                  | Purpose                                         |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `FitHub.Platform.Common`                   | Core shared utilities and helpers               |
| `FitHub.Platform.Common.Domain`            | Shared domain abstractions                     |
| `FitHub.Platform.Common.Service`           | Shared service-layer components                |
| `FitHub.Platform.Common.Repository`        | Shared data access patterns                    |

## Key Architecture Patterns

The **FitHub** platform implements several key architectural patterns:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between API, service, domain, and data access layers  
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on core domain models and business logic  
3. **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data access through repository interfaces  
4. **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components  
5. **Validation Pipeline**: Structured input validation using Fluent Validation
